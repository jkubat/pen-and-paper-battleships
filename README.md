## About Pen and Paper Battleship
Classic pen and paper board game for dads and kids. I was looking for a template on the Internet and found only paid templates or templates I don't like.

This is a game generator so that you can choose the battlefield size, colours, and other things. You have to print it after you are satisfied with the output.
