## About Pen and Paper Battleship
Classic pen and paber board game for dads and kids. I was looking for a template on Internet and found only payed templates or templates I don't like.

This is a generator of the game, so you can choose the battlefield size, colors, and other things.
You have to print it, after you'll be satisfied with the output.
